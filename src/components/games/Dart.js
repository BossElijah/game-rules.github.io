    <p>
      Being a “sport” – many argue it is a game – mainly played in pubs and
      requiring little or no physical fitness, darts is one activity at which
      Britain excels! Darts is thought to have been created when soldiers began
      throwing short arrows at cut tree trunks or alternatively at the bottom of
      the cask. As the wood dried cracks appeared, creating sections which,
      steadily, over time became set scores, albeit with much regional and
      international variation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Darts is now widely played in many parts of the world, but especially in
      former Commonwealth countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, the United
      States and Scandinavia. There are two main professional governing bodies,
      the PDC and BDO, the latter being the longer running of the two. Given the
      presence of the sport in pubs and bars it is probably one of the largest
      participatory sports in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Object of the Game</h2>
    <p>
      501 is the standard version of the game in competition and the object is
      to “check out” by getting your score down to 50 or less before ending the
      game by reaching zero by either throwing a double or a bullseye with your
      final dart.
    </p>

    <h2>Players & Equipment</h2>
    <p>
      Darts only requires a board and the darts themselves, this limited list of
      equipment being one of the reasons for its success. The board that is now
      used as standard was created in 1896 by a Lancashire carpenter with the
      aim of penalising inaccurate throwing by keeping large numbers apart and
      bordering them with small numbers. Whilst mathematicians have long argued
      over the best board layout to minimise the reward for inaccurate efforts,
      the current design is actually pretty good.
    </p>

    <p>
      The board itself is made from compressed sisal fibres and despite modern
      electronic versions is now the accepted norm. In the early days after the
      First World War darts was played using a heavy, solid wood board, normally
      made from elm and subsequently clay versions were trialled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard board is 17¾ inches (451mm) in diameter and is divided into
      20 radial sections by thin metal wire. The sections are numbered from 1-20
      and contain a thin section at the outer edge (double) and slightly smaller
      area midway towards the centre (treble). The bullseye or “bull” is a small
      circle, usually red, at the very centre of the board and is surrounded by
      the larger, green, outer bull.
    </p>

    <p>
      The darts are usually used using a combination of metal, nylon and plastic
      for the points, barrels, shafts and fletching. The exact style and make-up
      of the dart will vary according to the player’s style and ability (or what
      pub you’re in!) but they must weigh no more than 50g and be no longer than
      300mm.
    </p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      A player scores points by throwing the darts at the board. Each player
      throws three darts on their turn with the maximum score being 180,
      achieved by hitting three treble 20s. The bull is worth 50 points, the
      outer bull 25 points and the various numbers score their own value, unless
      they are doubled (the outer rim) or trebled.
    </p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>
      To win a player must reach zero by hitting a double or a bull, having
      first got their score down from the 501 starting point. If they do that
      they win the leg and the first to three legs wins the set. Most matches
      are normally played “best of” a defined (odd) number of sets, with the
      sport’s biggest prize, the PDC World Championship, involving a final that
      is best of 13 (therefore the winner is the first to seven sets).

    <h2>Rules of Darts</h2>
    <p>
      The rules of darts are very simple and have basically been discussed in
      previous sections. Some key points to note are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Which player takes the first turn in a game is decided by throwing a
        single dart each with the nearest to the bull taking the first throw.
      </li>
      <li>
        A throw consists of throwing three darts unless the game is won in
        fewer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only darts in the board at the end of the throw are counted and ones
        that bounce or fall out cannot be thrown again.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a player scores more than their remaining points total their throw
        ends and is scored zero (for example if they have 16 remaining and
        accidentally hit a 20 with their first dart).
      </li>
      <li>
        The centre of the bull should be exactly 5ft 8in (1.73 metres) high.
      </li>
      <li>
        Darts are thrown from a clearly marked toe-line, often called the oche,
        at least 7ft 9 ¼ in from the board, measured horizontally.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
